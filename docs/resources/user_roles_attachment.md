# pfptmeta_user_roles_attachment (Resource)

Attaches roles to user.

~> **NOTE:** The **pfptmeta_user_roles_attachment** resource creates **exclusive** role attachments.
Across the entire organization, all the roles attached to the user must be declared by a single pfptmeta_user_roles_attachment resource.
This means that any user with the roles attached using any other method, including other Terraform resources, will have its role attachments revoked.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  org_id = "org123abc"
}

resource "pfptmeta_user" "user" {
  given_name  = "John"
  family_name = "Smith"
  email       = "john.smith@example.com"
}

resource "pfptmeta_role" "metaport_role" {
  name          = "metaport role"
  apply_to_orgs = [local.org_id]
  privileges    = ["metaports:read", "metaports:write"]
}

resource "pfptmeta_role" "network_element_role" {
  name          = "network element role"
  apply_to_orgs = [local.org_id]
  privileges    = ["network_elements:read", "network_elements:write"]
}

resource "pfptmeta_user_roles_attachment" "attachment" {
  user_id = pfptmeta_user.user.id
  roles   = [pfptmeta_role.metaport_role.id, pfptmeta_role.network_element_role.id]
}
```
