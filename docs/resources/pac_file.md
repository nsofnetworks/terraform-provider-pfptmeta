# Resource (pfptmeta_pac_file)

Web traffic inspection is further enhanced by means of traffic steering rules (Implemented as Proxy Auto Config file), installed by the web security engine after the user has been onboarded. It is a JavaScript-based file that uses logical statements to determine which traffic is routed through the proxy and which traffic bypasses it. Each tenant has a default rule supplied by Proofpoint, based on the best practice recommendations. However, the administrators can decide to override the default rule with customized traffic steering rules that are better suited for their organization. Once created, the traffic steering rule is distributed to intended users to be hosted locally on their machines. Afterwards, the rule can be updated at any time.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pfptmeta_pac_file" "managed_pac" {
  name         = "pac file"
  description  = "pac file description"
  apply_to_org = true
  priority     = 15
  type         = "managed"
  managed_content = {
    domains     = ["apple.co"]
    cloud_apps  = ["ca-zcR3wRh1mQLyD", "ca-YbU9LeY4bCAuV"]
    ip_networks = ["ipn-wRvGyyK1mPEop"]
  }
}

resource "pfptmeta_pac_file" "byo_pac" {
  name         = "pac file"
  description  = "pac file description"
  apply_to_org = true
  priority     = 15
  type         = "bring_your_own"
  content      = <<EOF
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
// Don't proxy specific hostnames
if (
  shExpMatch(host, "*.apple.co")
  )
  return "DIRECT";
return "PROXY 127.0.0.1:43443";
}
EOF
}

resource "pfptmeta_pac_file" "byo_pac_with_file_path" {
  name         = "pac file"
  description  = "pac file description"
  apply_to_org = true
  priority     = 15
  type         = "bring_your_own"
  content      = file("path/to/file")
}
```
