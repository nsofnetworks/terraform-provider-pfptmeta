# Resource (pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment)

Attaches roles to group.

~> **NOTE:** The **pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment** resource creates **exclusive** role attachments.
Across the entire organization, all the roles attached to the group must be declared by a single pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment resource.
This means that any group with the roles attached using any other method, including other Terraform resources, will have its role attachments revoked.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  org_id = "org123abc"
}

resource "pfptmeta_group" "group" {
  name = "admins"
}

resource "pfptmeta_role" "metaport_role" {
  name          = "metaport role"
  apply_to_orgs = [local.org_id]
  privileges    = ["metaports:read", "metaports:write"]
}

resource "pfptmeta_role" "network_element_role" {
  name          = "network element role"
  apply_to_orgs = [local.org_id]
  privileges    = ["network_elements:read", "network_elements:write"]
}

resource "pfptmeta_group_roles_attachment" "attachment" {
  group_id = pfptmeta_group.group.id
  roles    = [pfptmeta_role.metaport_role.id, pfptmeta_role.network_element_role.id]
}
```
