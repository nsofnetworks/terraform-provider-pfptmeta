# Resource (pfptmeta_routing_group)

User routing groups is a logical group of subnets which co-exist at the same time. These are independent subnets, which can be the same or contain overlapping IP addresses that can be used without conflicting with each other.

When using the `mapped_element_ids` argument of this resource, the resource will take over the management of the Routing Group's mapped elements.
This argument is incompatible with other methods of managing Routing Group's mapped elements, such as `routing_group_mapped_elements_attachment`.
Any attempt to manage Routing Group's mapped elements using different methods, will result in resource cycling and/or errors.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pfptmeta_group" "group" {
  name = "group name"
}

resource "pfptmeta_network_element" "mapped-service" {
  name           = "mapped service"
  mapped_service = "mapped.service.com"
}

resource "pfptmeta_routing_group" "routing_group" {
  name                = "routing group name"
  description         = "routing group description"
  mapped_elements_ids = [pfptmeta_network_element.mapped-service.id]
  sources             = [pfptmeta_group.group.id]
}
```
