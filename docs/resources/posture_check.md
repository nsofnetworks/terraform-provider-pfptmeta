  Posture checks are administrator-defined sets of criteria allowing to or preventing the user devices from connecting to Proofpoint NaaS.
  Administrators can use SQL to create real-world conditions based on underlying information from the operating system and its hardware or choose from a list of common pre-defined conditions.
  For example, the presence (or absence) of a specified file or a system process can serve as a pre-condition for letting a device to access the Proofpoint NaaS.
  The posture checks can be based on SQL query strings. The queries use the osquery framework, see osquery.io https://osquery.io/ for details on osquery.
  Posture checks can be viewed and filtered by failure via security logs see here https://help.metanetworks.com/knowledgebase/posture_checks for more details.

# Resource (pfptmeta_posture_check)

Posture checks are administrator-defined sets of criteria allowing to or preventing the user devices from connecting to Proofpoint NaaS.
Administrators can use SQL to create real-world conditions based on underlying information from the operating system and its hardware or choose from a list of common pre-defined conditions.
For example, the presence (or absence) of a specified file or a system process can serve as a pre-condition for letting a device to access the Proofpoint NaaS.
The posture checks can be based on SQL query strings. The queries use the osquery framework, see [osquery.io](https://osquery.io/) for details on osquery.
Posture checks can be viewed and filtered by failure via security logs see [here](https://help.metanetworks.com/knowledgebase/posture_checks) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pfptmeta_user" "user" {
  given_name  = "John"
  family_name = "Smith"
  email       = "john.smith@example.com"
}

resource "pfptmeta_network_element" "device" {
  name     = "device-name"
  owner_id = pfptmeta_user.user.id
  platform = "Linux"
}

resource "pfptmeta_posture_check" "antivirus_check" {
  name                 = "CrowdStrike Posture Check1"
  description          = "Description"
  apply_to_entities    = [pfptmeta_network_element.device.id, pfptmeta_user.user.id]
  osquery              = "select * from processes where name='falcon-sensor' and state='S';"
  platform             = "Linux"
  enabled              = true
  action               = "NONE"
  when                 = ["PERIODIC", "PRE_CONNECT"]
  interval             = 60
  user_message_on_fail = "CrowdStrike is not installed on device1"
}

resource "pfptmeta_posture_check" "min_client_version" {
  name            = "Min Client Version1"
  apply_to_org    = true
  exempt_entities = [pfptmeta_user.user.id]
  check {
    type        = "minimum_app_version"
    min_version = "4.0.0"
  }
  platform             = "iOS"
  action               = "DISCONNECT"
  when                 = ["PRE_CONNECT"]
  user_message_on_fail = "CrowdStrike is not installed on device1"
