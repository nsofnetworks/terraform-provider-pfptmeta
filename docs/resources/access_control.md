  Device Access Control allows organizations to prevent clients from accessing unauthorized sites and services while they are connected to corporate resources.
  With this, organizations can block unfiltered/unmonitored client access when the users are connected to Proofpoint ZTNA.
  When Device Access Control is enabled, outgoing traffic from the endpoint is allowed if it is either:
  - Routed through Proofpoint ZTNA.
  - Destined to an allowed service on the Internet.
  Any other outgoing traffic is dropped.
  ~> NOTE: Proofpoint recommends the Device Access Control to be enabled only when a Web Security solution exists, and its IP ranges are allowed. Otherwise, users will fail to access the Internet when connected to Proofpoint ZTNA.
