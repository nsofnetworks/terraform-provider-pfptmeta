  Egress routes allow traffic from a defined source (groups, users, devices or any other network element) to be routed to a specific MetaPort.
  This can be useful for a variety of use cases including testing, security and compliance.
  For example, you can define egress rules for SaaS applications that require access from a specific region for regulatory purposes.

# Resource (pfptmeta_egress_route)

Egress routes allow traffic from a defined source (groups, users, devices or any other network element) to be routed to a specific MetaPort.
This can be useful for a variety of use cases including testing, security and compliance.
For example, you can define egress rules for SaaS applications that require access from a specific region for regulatory purposes.
You can set up egress rules to route traffic from a source to a MetaPort in your own data center or public cloud instance for service chaining or any type of traffic manipulation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_group" "group" {
  name = "group-name"
}

resource "pfptmeta_network_element" "mapped-subnet" {
  name           = "mapped subnet name"
  mapped_subnets = ["10.20.30.0/24"]
}

data "pfptmeta_location" "new_york" {
  name = "LGA"
}

resource "pfptmeta_egress_route" "via_mapped_subnet" {
  name         = "egress route name"
  description  = "egress route description"
  destinations = ["example.com"]
  sources      = [data.pfptmeta_group.group.id]
  via          = pfptmeta_network_element.mapped-subnet.id
}

resource "pfptmeta_egress_route" "via_region" {
  name         = "example"
  destinations = ["example.com"]
  sources      = [data.pfptmeta_group.group.id]
  via          = data.pfptmeta_location.new_york.name
}

resource "pfptmeta_egress_route" "DIRECT" {
  name         = "example"
  destinations = ["example.com"]
  sources      = [data.pfptmeta_group.group.id]
  via          = "DIRECT"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String)
- `via` (String) Defines how the traffic will be routed:
	- **DIRECT**: Directs the traffic to egress from the same PoP it has entered. Use it to override other, less specific egress rules.
	- **Mapped Subnet ID**: Directs the traffic to egress via specified mapped subnet.
	- **Region**: Directs the traffic to egress from a specific region, see `location` data-source.

### Optional

- `description` (String)
- `destinations` (List of String) Target hostnames or domains.
- `enabled` (Boolean)
- `exempt_sources` (List of String) Entities (users, groups, devices or network elements) to be excluded from the egress route.
- `sources` (List of String) Entities (users, groups, devices or network elements) to be affected by the egress route (cannot be a Mapped Subnet if `via` is also a Mapped Subnet).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
