  The trusted networks feature is a mechanism for auto-disconnecting from Proofpoint NaaS when the device is on a trusted network, such as corporate environment. The moment the device leaves the trusted network, it auto-reconnects to the Proofpoint NaaS.
    A user can still forcefully connect the device to the Proofpoint NaaS when on a trusted network, by clicking Connect in the Proofpoint Agent UI.
  Proofpoint Agent tries to detect if a trusted network is available, before re-connecting to a network (re-connect occurs if the device was connected to the Proofpoint NaaS and then switched networks).
    A trusted network is defined according to one of the following criteria:
    - DNS resolution of a hostname: When a specific hostname is resolved to an IP address that is within the defined IP range.
    - External IP address of the device: When the device external IP address is within the specified IP address range.

# Resource (pfptmeta_trusted_network)

The trusted networks feature is a mechanism for auto-disconnecting from Proofpoint NaaS when the device is on a trusted network, such as corporate environment. The moment the device leaves the trusted network, it auto-reconnects to the Proofpoint NaaS.
  A user can still forcefully connect the device to the Proofpoint NaaS when on a trusted network, by clicking Connect in the Proofpoint Agent UI.

  Proofpoint Agent tries to detect if a trusted network is available, before re-connecting to a network (re-connect occurs if the device was connected to the Proofpoint NaaS and then switched networks).
  A trusted network is defined according to one of the following criteria:
  - DNS resolution of a hostname: When a specific hostname is resolved to an IP address that is within the defined IP range.
  - External IP address of the device: When the device external IP address is within the specified IP address range.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pfptmeta_trusted_network" "network" {
  name         = "trusted network name"
  description  = "trusted network description"
  apply_to_org = true
  criteria {
    external_ip_config {
      addresses_ranges = ["192.1.0.0/16"]
    }
  }
  criteria {
    resolved_address_config {
      addresses_ranges = ["192.1.0.0/16"]
      hostname         = "office.address.com"
    }
  }
}
```

- `exempt_entities` (List of String) Entities (users, groups or network elements) which are not allowed to use trusted networks.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--criteria"></a>
### Nested Schema for `criteria`

Optional:

- `external_ip_config` (Block List, Max: 1) Specified IP address range to compare with the device's external IP for the network to be trusted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--criteria--external_ip_config))
- `resolved_address_config` (Block List, Max: 1) A hostname and specified IP address range in which the hostname must be resolved for the network to be trusted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--criteria--resolved_address_config))

Read-Only:

- `type` (String)

<a id="nestedblock--criteria--external_ip_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `criteria.external_ip_config`

Required:
