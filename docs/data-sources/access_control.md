  Device Access Control allows organizations to prevent clients from accessing unauthorized sites and services while they are connected to corporate resources.
  With this, organizations can block unfiltered/unmonitored client access when the users are connected to Proofpoint ZTNA.

# Data Source (pfptmeta_access_control)

Device Access Control allows organizations to prevent clients from accessing unauthorized sites and services while they are connected to corporate resources. 
With this, organizations can block unfiltered/unmonitored client access when the users are connected to Proofpoint ZTNA.

When Device Access Control is enabled, outgoing traffic from the endpoint is allowed if it is either:
- Routed through Proofpoint ZTNA.
- Destined to an allowed service on the Internet.
Any other outgoing traffic is dropped.

~> **NOTE:** Proofpoint recommends the Device Access Control to be enabled only when a Web Security solution exists, and its IP ranges are allowed. Otherwise, users will fail to access the Internet when connected to Proofpoint ZTNA.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_access_control" "access" {
  id = "ac-123abc"
}

output "access" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_access_control.access
}
```
