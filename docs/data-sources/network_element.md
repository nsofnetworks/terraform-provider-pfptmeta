# Data Source (pfptmeta_network_element)

Network elements comprise devices, mapped subnets and mapped services. 
- Creating this resource with `mapped_subnets` generates a Mapped Subnet-type network element..
- Creating this resource with `mapped_service` generates a Mapped Service-type network element.
- Creating this resource with `owner_id` and `platform` generates a Device-type network element.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_network_element" "my_subnet" {
  id = "ne-123"
}

output "mapped_subnet" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_network_element.my_subnet
}
```
