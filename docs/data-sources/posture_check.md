  Posture checks are administrator-defined sets of criteria allowing to or preventing the user devices from connecting to Proofpoint NaaS.
  Administrators can use SQL to create real-world conditions based on underlying information from the operating system and its hardware or choose from a list of common pre-defined conditions.
  For example, the presence (or absence) of a specified file or a system process can serve as a pre-condition for letting a device to access the Proofpoint NaaS.
  The posture checks can be based on SQL query strings. The queries use the osquery framework, see osquery.io https://osquery.io/ for details on osquery.
  Posture checks can be viewed and filtered by failure via security logs see here https://help.metanetworks.com/knowledgebase/posture_checks for more details.

# Data Source (pfptmeta_posture_check)

Posture checks are administrator-defined sets of criteria allowing to or preventing the user devices from connecting to Proofpoint NaaS.
Administrators can use SQL to create real-world conditions based on underlying information from the operating system and its hardware or choose from a list of common pre-defined conditions.
For example, the presence (or absence) of a specified file or a system process can serve as a pre-condition for letting a device to access the Proofpoint NaaS.
The posture checks can be based on SQL query strings. The queries use the osquery framework, see [osquery.io](https://osquery.io/) for details on osquery.
Posture checks can be viewed and filtered by failure via security logs see [here](https://help.metanetworks.com/knowledgebase/posture_checks) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_posture_check" "check" {
  id = "pc-123abc"
}

output "check" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_posture_check.check
}
```
