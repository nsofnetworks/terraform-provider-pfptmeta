# Data Source (pfptmeta_log_streaming_access_bridge)

Proofpoint log streaming allows you to send log data from the Proofpoint NaaS tenant to a third-party service in real time. 
Then, the log data can be stored and analyzed using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.
Proofpoint supports the following log streaming standards:

- Splunk-compatible HTTP Event Collector (HEC), enabling you to send data over HTTP (or HTTPS) directly to Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud from Proofpoint NaaS. Splunk HEC is token-based, eliminating the need to hard-code your Splunk credentials into Proofpoint-provided applications.
- IBM QRadar-compatible HTTP for collecting flow and event data from all of the log sources that are supported in your on-premises or cloud deployment.
- Amazon S3 service for direct streaming of the customer’s tenant logs to an AWS S3 bucket.
- Syslog Common Event Format (CEF), an open-source log management standard. CEF allows third parties to create their own device schemas that are compatible with industry-standard methods for normalizing security events.
- Proofpoint CASB - Proofpoint CASB service that accepts traffic or web security logs for subsequent shadow IT processing.
This integration enables organizations to govern user access to both IT-authorized and unauthorized apps (also known as shadow IT)

You can use [**pfptmeta_notification_channel**](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nsofnetworks/pfptmeta/latest/docs/resources/notification_channel) for receiving alerts on events from log streaming service.
When the log streamer status changes to one of the non-running states (error, suspended, stopped) a notification event is triggered.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_log_streaming_access_bridge" "log_streaming" {
  id = "crt-123abc"
}

output "log_streaming" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_log_streaming_access_bridge.log_streaming
}
```
