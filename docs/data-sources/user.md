# Data Source (pfptmeta_user)

Users are individuals in the organization, which their access and privileges to the organization resources are determined based on the security access policies.

Users can own multiple devices, each with a dedicated certificate that is used to identify the user’s device in the system.

Users can be provisioned in the system either by locally creating the users and groups from the Admin portal or API. Another, more common practice, is to provision users from an organization directory service, by way of SCIM or LDAP protocols.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_user" "user_by_id" {
  id = "usr-abc123"
}

data "pfptmeta_user" "user_by_email" {
  email = "John.Smith@example.com"
}

output "user_by_id" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_user.user_by_id
}

output "user_by_email" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_user.user_by_email
}
```
