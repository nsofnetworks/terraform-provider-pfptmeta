  The trusted networks feature is a mechanism for auto-disconnecting from Proofpoint NaaS when the device is on a trusted network, such as corporate environment. The moment the device leaves the trusted network, it auto-reconnects to the Proofpoint NaaS.
    A user can still forcefully connect the device to the Proofpoint NaaS when on a trusted network, by clicking Connect in the Proofpoint Agent UI.
  Proofpoint Agent tries to detect if a trusted network is available, before re-connecting to a network (re-connect occurs if the device was connected to the Proofpoint NaaS and then switched networks).
    A trusted network is defined according to one of the following criteria:
    - DNS resolution of a hostname: When a specific hostname is resolved to an IP address that is within the defined IP range.
    - External IP address of the device: When the device external IP address is within the specified IP address range.

# Data Source (pfptmeta_trusted_network)

The trusted networks feature is a mechanism for auto-disconnecting from Proofpoint NaaS when the device is on a trusted network, such as corporate environment. The moment the device leaves the trusted network, it auto-reconnects to the Proofpoint NaaS.
  A user can still forcefully connect the device to the Proofpoint NaaS when on a trusted network, by clicking Connect in the Proofpoint Agent UI.

  Proofpoint Agent tries to detect if a trusted network is available, before re-connecting to a network (re-connect occurs if the device was connected to the Proofpoint NaaS and then switched networks).
  A trusted network is defined according to one of the following criteria:
  - DNS resolution of a hostname: When a specific hostname is resolved to an IP address that is within the defined IP range.
  - External IP address of the device: When the device external IP address is within the specified IP address range.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_trusted_network" "network" {
  id = "tn-123abc"
}

output "network" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_trusted_network.network
}
```
