# Data Source (pfptmeta_alert)

Alerts let you monitor data including network traffic and activities, or various security events like password resets and missing certificates.
You can examine and filter any type of event, as well as define alert notifications to be sent to email, webhooks (integrating with SaaS apps), PagerDuty or Slack.
Alerts can be configured using either `spike_condition` or `threshold_condition`

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_alert" "alert" {
  id = "alr-123abc"
}

output "alert" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_alert.alert
}
```
